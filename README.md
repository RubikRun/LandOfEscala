# Land Of Escala is a 3D adventure third-person game made in Unreal Engine (WIP)
You're going around looking for the mystical Land of Escala. You find a village in the mountains. There is a big abandoned house up a big cliff.
People in the village tell you that you should reach the top floor of that house to get to Escala.
You can't reach there easily, you should go around different caves and forests looking for and collecting elixirs.
Those elixirs make you giant or small or make you fly, all needed to reach the top floor of the house.
There you find a portal to Escala and it takes you to the bottom of the lake where Escalians live.
